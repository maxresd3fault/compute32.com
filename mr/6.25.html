									<p>This month we are looking at something a little different. The <a href="https://www.dell.com/support/product-details/en-us/product/optiplex-7040-micro/overview" target="_blank">Optiplex 7040 Micro</a> is a great choice for a cheap general purpose server. This machine was originally meant to be a small form factor office PC, but it would work great as a server in a small space while not drawing much power.</p>
									<p>One thing to keep in mind is this machine only comes with 256GB of internal storage, you might need to upgrade it depending on your needs. For just about $100 with the power supply included this machine would be a great way to experiment with setting up your own home server.</p>
									<p>One great use case for a machine like this would be using it as a media server in your home, although you would most likely need to add more storage. It's size and low power draw makes it appealing for many beginners.</p>
									<p>For the price, this Dell is very good value. Dell makes reliable and easily serviceable hardware. Furthermore Dell provides great support for their older products by continuing to host drivers, BIOS updates, and manuals. The eBay seller (<a href="https://ebay.us/m/aXOYwc" target="_blank">Juluplus</a>) also includes a 30 day warranty.</p>
