									<p>Compute32.com was founded in late 2024 as a project aimed at helping home users purchase and set up surplus server equipment. The primary goal is to provide comprehensive guides that explain not only how to configure these machines but also how to deploy useful services on them. Additionally, we publish a monthly recommendation featuring a server model that offers good value for its price.</p>
									<p>Purchasing a surplus server can be an excellent way to bring powerful computing capabilities into your home without breaking the bank. Enterprise grade servers are designed with high performance and reliability in mind, making them well suited for a wide range of demanding tasks, from running virtual machines to hosting game servers or media libraries. A significant advantage of these servers is their use of specialized components that are often incompatible with consumer grade hardware. This incompatibility frequently makes such parts exceptionally affordable on the used market. Here are some examples of these components and their benefits:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>ECC Memory (Error Correction Code Memory): ECC memory includes an additional chip on the DIMM that performs error checking and correction. This feature is critical for applications where consistency and reliability are paramount, such as data storage, virtualization, and scientific computing. ECC memory significantly reduces the risk of downtime or crashes caused by memory errors. Despite its advantages, ECC memory cannot be used with most consumer motherboards, which helps keep its price low in the used market.</li>
										<li>SAS Drives (Serial Attached SCSI): SAS drives are the enterprise grade equivalent of SATA drives and are engineered for higher performance and durability. While modern servers often use NVMe SSDs for storage, many older enterprise machines rely on SAS hard drives. These drives offer greater reliability and faster performance compared to standard SATA drives. However, their incompatibility with consumer grade SATA interfaces and backplanes often leads to a surplus of affordable SAS drives in the secondhand market.</li>
										<li>Intel Xeon and AMD EPYC Processors: These processors are staples in the server industry, designed to handle heavy multicore workloads and ensure stable 24/7 operation. While some models can be used in consumer systems, their primary market is enterprise environments. As a result, they are typically priced lower than their consumer grade counterparts when resold. Xeon and EPYC CPUs excel at tasks requiring high parallel processing power, such as rendering, virtualization, and running databases.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>By encouraging the repurposing of surplus equipment, compute32.com aims to help users unlock enterprise-level performance for a fraction of the cost. Whether youâ€™re looking to build a homelab, host your own services, or simply experiment with server hardware, compute32.com is here to guide you.</p>
